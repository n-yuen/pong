# pong

You can set up this pong game on a server so that you and your friends can play and have fun because the ball moves at a normal speed.

After entering two different names (no, '-' is not a name), click on the "Start!" to play. For the left paddle, use W and S to move the paddle up and down. For the right paddle, use the up arrow and down arrow. You'll have lots of fun.

The game ends when one player has scored 25 points. The leaderboard displays player names with the most wins. If you want, you can enter the top player's name and pretend you're them.

This was assigned in my CS class in 2017.
